Link: [Project-2.HH_Job_openings_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/helios12/DataScienceProjects/blob/main/projects/project-2/Project-2.HH_Job_openings_analysis.ipynb)

The goal of the project was to practise SQL knowledge on a database which contained the HeadHunger job openings. Using the SQL queries different analyses should be made revealing the patterns in the data. The analysis consisted of th the following sections:

* Preliminary data analysis to investigate the data structure
* Detailed job openings analysis with the focus on the data in the 'vacancies' table
* Employer analysis to identify patterns in for employers and their job openings
* Data science job openings analysis to get more insights into this courese's industry 

## Technology stack
Whily working on this project I have mastered:

* SQL
* python
* psycopg2
* pandas
* BeautifulSoup

## Conclusions
* HeadHunter covers a large geographic area and includes jobs from many industries, which makes it attractive for a large number of employers and job seekers.
* The service has job openings from huge employers like Yandex as well as from very small companies. This proves that the business model of HeadHunter makes it very accessible for all types and sizes of businesses. 
* The fact that only 7% of the employers are involved into software development confirms that HeadHunter is not a purely IT oriented platform.
* With Yandex as the largest client represented in many geographic areas I would recommend HeadHunter to put a special team to handle Yandex to increase the customer satisfaction.
* Data related jobs and data science in particular are a solid part of all job openings base. However not too many positions are available for the beginners.
