# Project 7. Identification of vulnerable population groups
Link: [Project-7.Identification_of_vulnerable_population_groups.ipynb](https://github.com/helios12/DataScienceProjects/blob/main/projects/project-7/Project-7.Identification_of_vulnerable_population_groups.ipynb)

The goal of the project was to identify vulnerable population groups and to point out the regions of Russia which require assistance for the low-income segements of the population. The project has numerous data sources like population statistics over years, child mortality, income, living conditions etc. The data needs to be cleaned, loaded and prepared to train a model. While cleaning the data a visual analysis of data must be performed.

In the data preparation step I have used the following techniques:

* Data cleaning
* Plotly Express to visualize data
* Data normalization
* K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering, Gaussian Mixture, Spectral Clustering and DBSCAN models

## Technology stack
Whily working on this project I have mastered:

* python
* pandas
* Plotly Express
* scikit-learn

## Conclusions
* For each of the data sources a list of regions has been identified where the population is vulnerable based on the data source criteria
* A list of regions has been identified using the clustering models which require assistance for the low-income segements of the population.
