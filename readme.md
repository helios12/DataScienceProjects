# Data Science Projects
During my Data Scientist course at SkillFactory I am solving tasks and working on projects. I am presenting the solutions of those tasks and projects as well as auxiliary code here for any potential employers. 
If you are just interested in data science, please feel free to contact me with any questions.
## Highlights
For the moment the following task on the data science jobs analysis including data cleaning and exploratory data analysis with visual and statistical methods, is the most illustrative example of my work: [Task-2.Data_Science_job_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/helios12/DataScienceProjects/blob/main/tasks/task-2/Task-2.Data_Science_job_analysis.ipynb)

In addition I am working on a library of reusable code for data-science purposes:

## Repo Structure
### Projects
Link: [Projects](https://github.com/helios12/DataScienceProjects/tree/main/projects)

#### Project 2. Analysis of the HeadHunter.ru job openings. 
The goal of the project was to practise SQL knowledge on a database which contained the HeadHunger job openings. Using the SQL queries different analyses should be made revealing the patterns in the data. See: [Project-2.HH_Job_openings_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/helios12/DataScienceProjects/blob/main/projects/project-2/Project-2.HH_Job_openings_analysis.ipynb)

For more details see: [Project-2 -> readme](https://github.com/helios12/DataScienceProjects/blob/main/projects/project-2/readme.md)

#### Project 1. Analysis of the HeadHunter.ru resumes. 
The goal of the project was to perform data preparation and clean-up before building a machine learning model. The model should be able to predict a candidate salary based on other candidate attributes. See: [Project-1.HH_Resume_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/helios12/DataScienceProjects/blob/main/projects/project-1/Project-1.HH_Resume_analysis.ipynb)

For more details see: [Project-1 -> readme](https://github.com/helios12/DataScienceProjects/blob/main/projects/project-1/readme.md)

### Tasks
Link: [Tasks](https://github.com/helios12/DataScienceProjects/tree/main/tasks)

#### Task 2. Data science job analysis. 
The goal of the task was to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a data set of data science related jobs. The EDA consisted of a visual analysis and of picking and performing statistical tests. See: [Task-2.Data_Science_job_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/helios12/DataScienceProjects/blob/main/tasks/task-2/Task-2.Data_Science_job_analysis.ipynb)

For more details see: [Task-2 -> readme](https://github.com/helios12/DataScienceProjects/blob/main/tasks/task-2/readme.md)

#### Task 1. Research of bank customers churn data. 
The goal of the task was to analyze the bank customers data set and unsing the visual library plotly identify the possible reasons why the customers are exiting their relationship with the bank. See: [Task-1.Research_Of_Bank_Customers_Churn.ipynb](https://github.com/helios12/DataScienceProjects/blob/main/tasks/task-1/Task-1.Research_Of_Bank_Customers_Churn.ipynb)

For more details see: [Task-1 -> readme](https://github.com/helios12/DataScienceProjects/blob/main/tasks/task-1/readme.md)

### Data Science Helpers
Link: [Data Science Helpers](https://github.com/helios12/DataScienceProjects/tree/main/DataScienceHelpers)

In this folder I am collecting auxiliary code for any data science purposes. Currently it contains functions for finding attributes having a certain ratio of empty values, low information attributes and outliers. 

For more details see:
