# Data Science Projects
During my Data Scientist course at SkillFactory I am solving tasks and working on projects. I am presenting the solutions of those tasks and projects as well as auxiliary code here for any potential employers. 
If you are just interested in data science, please feel free to contact me with any questions.
## Highlights
For the moment the following task on visual research of bank customers churn is the most illustrative example of my work:
[Research of bank customers churn data](https://github.com/helios12/DataScienceProjects/blob/main/tasks/research-of-bank-customers-churn-module-13.ipynb)

In addition I am working on a library of reusable code for data-science purposes:
[Data Science Helpers](https://github.com/helios12/DataScienceProjects/tree/main/DataScienceHelpers)
## Repo Structure
### Data Science Helpers
Link: [Data Science Helpers](https://github.com/helios12/DataScienceProjects/tree/main/DataScienceHelpers)

In this folder I am collecting auxiliary code for any data science purposes. Currently it contains functions for finding attributes having a certain ratio of empty values, low information attributes and outliers. 

For more details see: 
[Data Science Helpers -> readme](https://github.com/helios12/DataScienceProjects/blob/main/DataScienceHelpers/readme.md)
### Projects
Link: [Projects](https://github.com/helios12/DataScienceProjects/tree/main/projects)

Currently I have not finished any projects yet, but I will place the solutions of the future projects in this folder.

### Tasks
Link: [Tasks](https://github.com/helios12/DataScienceProjects/tree/main/tasks)

The following tasks have been solved in the frames of the Data Science course at SkillFactory:

* Research of bank customers churn data. The goal of the task was to analyze the bank customers data set and unsing the visual library plotly identify the possible reasons why the customers are exiting their relationship with the bank.
