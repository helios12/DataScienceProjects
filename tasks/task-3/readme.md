Link: [Task-3.Introduction-to-comet-ml.ipynb](https://github.com/helios12/DataScienceProjects/blob/main/tasks/task-3/Task-3.Introduction-to-comet-ml.ipynb)

The goal of the task was to perform basic data cleaning, exploratory data model and building a logistic regression model. Diagrams, parameters and metrics have been logged to Comet ML. 

## Technology Stack
While working on this task I have mastered:

* python
* pandas
* plotly express
* Comet ML

## Conclusions
Comet ML is a very useful tool to log experiments data. Data of multiple experiments can be saved alongside. It is easy to compare experiments with each other.
