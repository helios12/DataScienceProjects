# Tasks
In this folder I am giving a brief description of the tasks, which have been solved in the course of the Data Science course at SkillFactory

## Repo Structure
### Research of bank customers churn data
Link: [data-visualization-module-13.ipynb](https://github.com/helios12/DataScienceProjects/blob/main/tasks/data-visualization-module-13.ipynb)
The goal of the task was to analyze the bank customers data set and unsing the visual library plotly identify the possible reasons why the customers are exiting their relationship with the bank. 

### Technology Stack
While working on this library I have mastered:

* python
* pandas
* plotly express
#### Conclusions
The bank has increased exit rate for the following categories of customers:
* Customers at the age of 38 years old and higher
* Customers with savings accounts
* Women customers
* Customers owning 3 or 4 products with the bank
* Inactive members
* Customers from Germany

My recommendation to the bank would be to make targeted special offeres to the customers belonging to these categories. Investigation of the competitors offers can be very usesful. Since the customers are not leaving to nowhere (they are most probably leaving to a different bank), the bank should bring the conditions closer to the competition at least for the mentioned customer categories. By exceeding the competitors conditions the bank can count on customers switching from other banks.
