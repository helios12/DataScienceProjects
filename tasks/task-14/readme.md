# Task-14. Variational Autoencoder
Link: [Task-14-Variational_autoencoder_VAE.ipynb](https://github.com/helios12/DataScienceProjects/blob/main/tasks/task-14/Task-14-Variational_autoencoder_VAE.ipynb)

The goal of the task is to define and train a variational autoencoder model using the Frey rawface dataset. Use reparametrization and VAE specific loss function. Then visualize the images reconstructed by the decoder and make sure that reconstructed images get sharper as the algorithm is progressing through the epochs.

## Technology Stack
While working on this task I have mastered:

* python
* pytorch
* Variational autoencoder
* Matplotlib

## Conclusions
I was able to define and train the variational autoencoder model. Images received via reconstruction by the decoder get sharper as the algorithm is progressing through the epochs.
