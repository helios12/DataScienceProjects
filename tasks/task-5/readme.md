# Task-5. Machine Learning. Feature Selection
Link: [Task-5.ML_feature_selection.ipynb](https://github.com/helios12/DataScienceProjects/blob/main/tasks/task-5/Task-5.ML_feature_selection.ipynb)

The goal of the task was to apply the RFE and the filter-based methods for the feature selection, identify the important features, train the models on those features. Calculate metrics for the models and evaluate which of the feature selection methods is more efficient.

## Technology Stack
While working on this task I have mastered:

* python
* sklearn
* pandas

## Conclusions
For the current dataset the filter-based method has identified a better feature set resulting in a better R2 metric of the model built on the selected features.
